# Project Report: Linear Regression Streamlit Application

## 1. Project Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a web-based application to demonstrate linear regression. The application, built with Python and Streamlit, allows users to generate their own data, fit a linear regression model, and visualize the results, including the identification of outliers.

## 2. Implemented Features

The application includes the following features:

- **Interactive Controls**: Sliders and input fields to control the data generation parameters (slope, noise, sample size, and random seed).
- **Linear Regression Modeling**: Fits a scikit-learn `LinearRegression` model to the generated data.
- **Performance Metrics**: Reports the learned slope, intercept, RÂ² score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Interactive Plot**: A scatter plot of the data points with the fitted regression line drawn in red.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and labels the top 5 outliers based on their absolute residuals.
- **Data Export**: A download button to export the generated dataset (including predictions and residuals) as a CSV file.

## 3. Development and Debugging Process

The development process involved creating the Streamlit application from scratch, including the UI, data generation, modeling, and plotting components. The project also went through a refactoring phase where the initial two-part structure (Synthetic Data and Iris Dataset) was simplified to focus solely on the synthetic data analysis.

During the deployment phase, several technical challenges were encountered and resolved:
- **Environment Issues**: The initial attempts to run the application were hampered by issues related to the system's PATH and multiple Python installations. This was resolved by identifying the correct Python executable.
- **Interactive Prompts**: The application failed to start due to an interactive prompt from Streamlit on its first run. This was resolved by running the application in headless mode.
- **Code Errors**: An `IndentationError` in the application code was identified and fixed.

## 4. Final Status

The Streamlit application is fully functional and focuses on demonstrating linear regression with synthetic data. The application is running and accessible at http://localhost:8501.

## 5. How to Run the Application

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    python -m streamlit run app.py
    ```
