# Development Log - 2025-09-23

This log summarizes the development and debugging tasks performed today.

## 1. Initial Setup and File Creation

- **Task:** Review a steps file and create a todo list.
- **Action:**
    - Checked `ref/require1.md` but found it was empty.
    - Created a new file `todo1.md` with placeholder text to help the user get started.

## 2. Streamlit Application Development

- **Task:** Build a Python (Streamlit) app for linear regression analysis.
- **Action:**
    - Created the main application file `app.py` with two tabs:
        - **Synthetic Data:** For linear regression on generated data, including outlier detection.
        - **Iris Dataset:** For linear regression on the Iris dataset.
    - Created `requirements.txt` with all the necessary dependencies.
    - Created `README.md` with instructions on how to install dependencies and run the application.

## 3. Application Deployment and Debugging

- **Task:** Install dependencies and run the Streamlit application.
- **Action & Debugging Steps:**
    1.  Installed dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    2.  Attempted to run the app, but encountered a series of issues.
    3.  **Issue 1: `streamlit` command not found.**
        - **Reason:** The script's location was not in the system's PATH.
        - **Solution:** Switched to running the app using `python -m streamlit`.
    4.  **Issue 2: `No module named streamlit`.**
        - **Reason:** Multiple Python versions were installed, and the default `python` command was pointing to a different installation than where the packages were installed.
        - **Solution:** Identified the correct Python executable and used it to run the application.
    5.  **Issue 3: `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.**
        - **Reason:** The application was not starting correctly. Running it in the foreground revealed an interactive prompt from Streamlit asking for an email address, which was blocking the process.
        - **Solution:** Ran the application in headless mode (`--server.headless true`) to skip the interactive prompt.
    6.  **Issue 4: `IndentationError` in `app.py`.**
        - **Reason:** A line of code had incorrect indentation.
        - **Solution:** Corrected the indentation in `app.py` and restarted the application.

## 4. Feature Requirement Update

- **Task:** Add a requirement to label outliers.
- **Action:**
    - Updated `ref/require1.md` to include the user's new requirement.
    - Confirmed that the outlier labeling feature was already implemented in the existing `app.py`.

## 5. Task Summary File Creation

- **Task:** Create a `todo.md` file summarizing all completed tasks.
- **Action:**
    - Created `todo.md` with a checklist of all the tasks performed during the session.
