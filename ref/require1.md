# Part A: Synthetic Linear Data Requirements

## Plotting

- Create a scatter plot of all points.
- Draw the fitted regression line in red across the x-range.
- Identify top 5 outliers by largest absolute residuals |y - Å·| (computed on the full dataset, not just test).
- Label those top 5 outliers directly on the plot (e.g., annotate each point with its rank or residual value).
